 Network Block Device is a Linux protocol designed to export a block device from a source computer (server) to a target (client)
Use dd to create an empty file
Define the item to be shared by the server in a configuration file
Activate the nbd kernel module
Query the server with the client using the export name, IP address and port
Associate the local /dev/nbd block driver with the server with the nbd-client command
Use fdisk to partition the nbd
Add a filesystem to the nbd and mount it

nbdkit: CentOS, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu
nbd-client and nbd-server: Ubuntu, Debian
nbd (from GitHub): CentOS, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu
xNBD-client and xNBD-server: Debian
qemu-img: CentOS
