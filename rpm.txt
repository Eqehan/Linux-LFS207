All rpm inquiries include the -q option, which can be combined with numerous other query options:
-f: allows you to determine which package a file came from
-l: lists the contents of a specific package
-a: all the packages installed on the system
-i: information about the package
-p: run the query against a package file instead of the package database

$ rpm -q bash
$ rpm -qf /bin/bash
$ rpm -ql bash
$ rpm -qi bash
$ rpm -q --requires bash
$ rpm -q --whatprovides libc.so.6

The -V option to rpm allows you to verify whether the files from a particular package are consistent with the systemâ€™s RPM database. Use the rpm -Va command to verify all packages on the system.
