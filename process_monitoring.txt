*** PROCESS MONITORING ***
Keeping track of running (and sleeping) processes is an essential system administration task.
ps

top		Process activity, dynamically updated
uptime		How long the system is running and the average load
ps		Detailed information about processes
pstree		A tree of processes and their connections
mpstat		Multiple processor usage
iostat		CPU utilization and I/O statistics
sar		Display and collect information about system activity
numastat	Information about NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Architecture)
strace		Information about all system calls a process makes

-o option allows the user to print out a selected list of ps fields.
pid: 	Process ID
uid: 	User ID of process owner
cmd: 	Command with all arguments
cputime: Cumulative CPU time
pmem: 	Ratio of the process's resident set size to the physical memory on the machine, expressed as a percentage
$ ps -o pid

$ pstree -aAp 2408	

ls /proc	/proc contains a subdirectory for each active process, named by the process id (PID)
/proc/self is the currently executing process.

>>Memory Monitoring Utilities
free	Brief summary of memory usage	
vmstat	Detailed virtual memory statistics and block I/O, dynamically updated	
pmap	Process memory map	

$ vmstat [options] [delay] [count]
If the option -S m is given, memory statistics will be in MB instead of KB.
the -a option, vmstat displays information about active and inactive memory
$ vmstat -SM -a 2 4

The pseudofile /proc/meminfo contains a wealth of information about how memory is being used.
$ cat /proc/meminfo
The /proc/sys/vm directory contains many tunable knobs to control the Virtual Memory system.
$ ls /proc/sys/vm


$ cat /proc/swaps
$ free -m
mkswap: format swap partitions or files
swapon: activate swap partitions or files
swapoff: deactivate swap partitions or files

OOM Killer Algorithms
One can modify and even turn off overcommission by setting the value of /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory:
0: (default) Permit overcommission, but refuse obvious overcommits
1: All memory requests are allowed to overcommit.
2: Turn off overcommission.
